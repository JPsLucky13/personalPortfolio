                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Jean-Paul, a software engineer and a avid videogame player. I am known for my work on various titles such as Hogwartz Legacy, Lego Brawls and crayola mobile games.
                    Today, I am studying and working to become a full-stack developer and make amazing projects!
                    In my free time I like to read comics and collect trophies from the games I love to play!
                    I also play music.
                </p>
